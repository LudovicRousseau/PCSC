Welcome to PCSC Lite.  The purpose of PCSC Lite is to
provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small form factor for
communicating to smartcards and readers. PCSC Lite can be compiled
directly to a desired reader driver or can be used to dynamically
allocate/deallocate reader drivers at runtime (default).

PCSC Lite uses the same winscard api as used under Windows(R).  

For security aware persons please read the SECURITY file on possible
vulnerabilites to pcsclite, how you can fix some, and how some will
be fixed.

For information on how to install driver please read the DRIVERS file.

Memory cards are supported through MCT specifications which is an APDU
like manner sent normally through the SCardTransmit() function.  This
functionality is done in the driver. 

INSTALLATION:

Installation is simple.  Type ./configure and then make and make install.
Options:

   ./configure 

          --enable-libusb=PATH   Enable USB libusb support
                                 (on Linux, *BSD, etc.).
          --enable-usb           Enable USB on Linux 2.4 platforms (deprecated)
          --enable-daemon        Run as a daemon.
          --enable-debug         Enable full debugging messages
          --enable-threadsafe    Enable a thread safe client (reqs pthread)
          --enable-debugatr      Enable ATR parsing debug output
          --prefix=location      Install to <location>
          --enable-confdir=DIR   Use DIR as the configuration directory
                                 (/etc by default)
          --enable-runpid=FILE   Store the daemon pid in file FILE

--enable-daemon, --enable-debug, and --enable-threadsafe are all default.
By running pcscd under a priveledged account you can link to 
libpcsclite.so and it will act as a client to the pcscd allowing multiple 
applications to be run under non-priveledged accounts.

Then type make install to copy etc/reader.conf to
/etc/reader.conf and the libraries to /usr/local/pcsc/lib. If you choose 
not to have your reader.conf in /etc  then edit the file include/pcsclite.h 
and edit the PCSC_READER_CONFIG option and change the
Makefile to make install to your location. 

You must be root to do make install in the default locations.

Be sure to edit the /etc/reader.conf file to fit your needs and make sure
your IFD Handler driver is located in the path specified as LIBRARYPATH
in reader.conf.  If you are using a reader with multiple smartcard slots
all you have to do is define a different FRIENDLYNAME in the reader.conf
for each reader.  Both will have the same information otherwise.  

There is an config file generator in the utils directory.  It is called
installifd.  You may use this to generate the /etc/reader.conf file.

USB users do not need to use the /etc/reader.conf.  pcscd will give
a warning that the file does not exist or contain anything useful.  

If you try out the test programs included in this package be sure to set your 
system's LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the locations where the libs are or move the
libpcsclite.so into a directory that is specified in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 

There is a test program with this package:

testpcsc: Linked to libpcsclite.  Must run /usr/local/pcsc/bin/pcscd
          and then ./testpcsc.  pcscd must be run as root or a hardware
          priveledged user.  ./testpcsc can be run under any account.
          You can create testpcsc by doing the following:
          gcc -o testpcsc test.c -L/usr/local/pcsc/lib -lpcsclite -I.

THREAD SAFETY:
If pcsc-lite is compiled with thread safety, each application linked with
libpcsclite.so must also link with pthread libraries.

OCF users should compile in --threadsafe so the OCF->PC/SC bridge behaves
correctly.

LIBUSB SUPPORT:
Versions after 1.2.0 support libusb. Available on GNU/Linux and *BSD.
In order to use it, you should call ./configure with

	--enable-libusb (if libusb is installed in standard directory /usr)
	or
	--enable-libusb=PATH

where PATH is the base directory containing the libusb include
file and library. For example, "--enable-libusb=/usr/local" looks
for /usr/local/include/usb.h and /usr/local/lib/libusb.[so|a]

Please note that you can't specify "--enable-libusb" and
"--enable-usb" at the same time.

In order to use dynamic driver loading, you need to supply a directory
called "XXXX.bundle" in the usb dropdir directory (--enable-usbdropdir=PATH).
Here, the string "XXXX" stands for an arbitrary driver name, like in
"ifd-GemPC430.bundle". An example .bundle-directory can be found in the
source distribution of the ifd-gempc driver
(http://ludovic.rousseau.free.fr/softwares/ifd-GemPC/ifd-GemPC.html)

SOLARIS:
Solaris PC/SC applications must link with -lsocket since
the libraries are not statically linked.
