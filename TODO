- include Apple patches and improvements (if possible/needed)

- power on the card _only_ if an application requests a connection
  see Alioth bug #301965
  That could be implemented by polling the reader only if an application
  requests it.

- allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two different machines.
  That would be needed to support remote PAM login.
  Maybe use unix2tcp (http://dizzy.roedu.net/unix2tcp/)

- manage power suspend/resume (in a laptop for example) and coordinate
  with the driver (when/if possible)

- start pcscd only when a reader is connected. Use HAL to detect USB
  reader insertion? use an external launcher like launch on Mac OS X?
  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=233762

- start pcscd as an normal user daemon (as id smartcard?) instead as
  root.  Of course the smart card readers should be accessible by this
  user (use UDEV rule files to set the correct access rights).
