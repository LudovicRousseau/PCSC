- improve performances between pcscd and libpcsclite
  see http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2005-q4/0086.html

- include Apple patches and improvements (if possible/needed)

- Allow connection from a 32-bits and 64-bits client to the same pcscd
  server. This is part of the Apple patches and improvements.
  see Alioth bug #303790

- power on the card _only_ if an application requests a connection
  see Alioth bug #301965
  That could be implemented by polling the reader only if an application
  requests it.

- use a callback from IFD handler to pcscd instead of polling to get the
  card status: better performance, possible lower power consumption

- allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two different machines.
  That would be needed to support remote PAM login.
  Maybe use unix2tcp (http://dizzy.roedu.net/unix2tcp/)

- manage power suspend/resume (in a laptop for example) and coordinate
  with the driver (when/if possible)
