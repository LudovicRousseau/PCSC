By default pcsc-lite will use polkit to control access to the pcsc-lite
daemon.

For now, only GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are supported. Patches are welcome
for other platforms.
Configure pcsc-lite with -Dpolkit=false if polkit is not available for
your platform.

That allows more fine grained access control to smart cards that
is tied to the system processes rather than solely depending on
the smart card controls (e.g., only console users can access the 
card and so on). 

Polkit is documented at:
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html

A default polkit policy is shipped with pcsc-lite in
org.debian.pcsc-lite.policy.  The policy file allows restricting access
to the daemon as well as access to smart cards.

Polkit allows for additional rules, e.g., restricting access to
particular smart cards. The rules are javascript files placed
in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/. To make specific smart card 
reader accessible by the web server (run as www-data user) you 
may use the following rules:

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.debian.pcsc-lite.access_card" &&
        action.lookup("reader") == 'name of reader' &&
        subject.user == "www-data") {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.debian.pcsc-lite.access_pcsc" &&
        subject.user == "www-data") {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});


Note that the name of the reader can be obtained using "opensc-tool -l"
or "pcsc_scan".
