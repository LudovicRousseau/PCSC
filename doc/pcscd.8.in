.SH DESCRIPTION
pcscd is the daemon program for pcsc-lite and the MuscleCard framework. It is 
a resource manager that coordinates communications with smart card readers 
and smart cards and cryptographic tokens that are connected to the system.

pcscd is normally started at boot time from 
.IR @sysconfdir_exp@/init.d/pcscd .
It allows applications to access smart cards and readers without knowing
details of the card or reader.  

pcscd coordinates the loading of drivers for card readers and plug-ins 
for different card types.

The purpose of pcsc-lite is to provide both a cross compatible API for
migrating Windows based PC/SC applications to Unix and to provide a 
pluggable architecture for supporting smart cards and cryptographic tokens 
through high level API's.

At startup, pcscd loads the smart card reader drivers specified in the 
.I @confdir@/reader.conf 
file (or specified using \fB-c\fR \fIfile\fR).

When a smart card is inserted into a reader, pcscd uses the ATR string from 
the card to identify this card.  The 
.I @muscledropdir@
directory contains plug-ins for the card.  These plug-ins are searched.  If 
the ATR string matches, the client library loads that plug-in for that 
token.
.SH "SERIAL SMART CARD READER DRIVERS"
Smart card reader drivers are placed in the 
.I @usbdropdir@
directory. Each driver is simply an 
.I .so 
file.  pcscd locates the driver using the 
.I @confdir@/reader.conf 
file.  See the
.BR reader.conf (5)
manual page for more information.
Drivers are available at \fIhttp://www.musclecard.com/drivers.html\fR.

.SH "SMART CARD PLUG-INS"
pcsc-lite uses plug-ins to handle different types of smart cards. There is 
a plug-in for each smart card type. Plug-ins are installed in the 
.I @muscledropdir@
directory.  Plug-ins for cards/tokens are available from the MUSCLE
web site \fIhttp://www.musclecard.com/\fR.
