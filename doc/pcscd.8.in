.SH DESCRIPTION
pcscd is the daemon program for pcsc-lite and MuscleCard framework. It is 
a resource manager that coordinates communications with smart card readers 
and smart cards and cryptographic tokens that are connected to the system.

pcscd is normally started at boot time from 
.IR /etc/init.d/pcscd .
It allows applications to access smart cards and readers without knowing
details of the card or reader.  

pcscd coordinates the loading of drivers for card readers and plug-ins 
for different card types.

The purpose of pcsc-lite is to provide both a cross compatible API for
migrating Windows based PC/SC applications to Unix and to provide a 
pluggable architecture for supporting smart cards and cryptographic tokens 
through high level API's.

At startup, pcscd loads the smart card reader drivers specified in the 
.I @confdir@/reader.conf 
file (or specified using \fB-c\fR \fIfile\fR).

When a smart card is inserted into a reader, pcscd uses the ATR string from 
the card to identify this card.  The 
.I @muscledropdir@
directory contains plug-ins for the card.  These plug-ins are searched.  If 
the ATR string matches, the client library loads that plug-in for that 
token.
.SH "SERIAL SMART CARD READER DRIVERS"
Smart card reader drivers are placed in the 
.I @usbdropdir@
directory. Each driver is simply an 
.I .so 
file.  The pcscd locates the driver with the 
.I @confdir@/reader.conf 
file.  The file has the following format:

 # comment
 FRIENDLYNAME <Descriptive name>
 DEVICENAME   <Short name>
 LIBPATH      <Location of the driver library>
 CHANNELID    <Hexadecimal channel identificator>

.IP FRIENDLYNAME 
is a user friendly name of the reader that is served by this driver.
This name is displayed to the user when necessary.

.IP DEVICENAME 
is a driver specific value.  If you do not know this value,
GEN_SMART_RDR is a good choice.
	
.IP LIBPATH 
is the full path to the shared library. 

.IP CHANNELID 
is the channel ID for serial port smart card readers.  This could vary 
depending on the driver in which you are using - check the driver README
for more information.  Some use the following:

 \fI/dev/ttyS0\fR (COM1) ->  0x0103F8 or 1
 \fI/dev/ttyS1\fR (COM2) ->  0x0102F8 or 2
 \fI/dev/ttyS2\fR (COM3) ->  0x0103E8 or 3
 \fI/dev/ttyS3\fR (COM4) ->  0x0102E8 or 4
.PP
Example:

 # Configuration file for pcsc-lite
 
 FRIENDLYNAME "My Smart card Reader"
 DEVICENAME   GEN_SMART_RDR
 LIBPATH      @usbdropdir@/my_reader.so
 CHANNELID    0x0103F8
 
 # End of file

Multiple drivers can be listed in 
.I @confdir@/reader.conf.

Drivers are available at \fIhttp://www.musclecard.com/drivers.html\fR.
.SH "SMART CARD PLUG-INS"
pcsc-lite uses plug-ins to handle different types of smart cards. There is 
a plug-in for each smart card type. Plug-ins are installed in the 
.I @muscledropdir@
directory.  Plug-ins for cards/tokens are available from the MUSCLE
web site \fIhttp://www.musclecard.com\fR.
