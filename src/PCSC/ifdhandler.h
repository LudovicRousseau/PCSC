/**
 * @file
 * @defgroup IFDHandler IFDHandler
 * @brief This provides reader specific low-level calls.

The routines specified hereafter will allow you to write an IFD handler
for the PC/SC Lite resource manager. Please use the complement
developer's kit complete with headers and Makefile at:
https://muscle.apdu.fr/musclecard.com/sourcedrivers.html

This gives a common API for communication to most readers in a
homogeneous fashion. This document assumes that the driver developer is
experienced with standards such as ISO-7816-(1, 2, 3, 4), EMV and MCT
specifications. For listings of these specifications please access the
above web site.

@section UsbReaders USB readers

USB readers use the bundle approach so that the reader can be loaded
and unloaded upon automatic detection of the device. The bundle
approach is simple: the actual library is just embedded in a
directory so additional information can be gathered about the device.

A bundle looks like the following:

@verbatim
GenericReader.bundle/
  Contents/
    Info.plist  - XML file describing the reader
    MacOS/      - Driver directory for OS X
    Solaris/    - Driver directory for Solaris
    Linux/      - Driver directory for Linux
    HPUX/       - Driver directory for HPUX
@endverbatim

The @c Info.plist file describes the driver and gives the loader
all the necessary information. The following must be contained in the
@c Info.plist file:

@subsection ifdVendorID

The vendor ID of the USB device.

Example:

@verbatim
    <key>ifdVendorID</key>
    <string>0x04E6</string>
@endverbatim

You may have an OEM of this reader in which an additional @c \<string>
can be used like in the below example:

@verbatim
    <key>ifdVendorID</key>
    <array>
      <string>0x04E6</string>
      <string>0x0973</string>
    </array>
@endverbatim

If multiples exist all the other parameters must have a second value
also. You may chose not to support this feature but it is useful when
reader vendors OEM products so you only distribute one driver.


The CCID driver from Ludovic Rousseau https://ccid.apdu.fr/ uses this
feature since the same driver supports many different readers.

@subsection ifdProductID

   The product id of the USB device.

@verbatim
   <key>ifdProductID</key>
   <string>0x3437</string>
@endverbatim

@subsection ifdFriendlyName

   Example:

@verbatim
   <key>ifdFriendlyName</key>
   <string>SCM Microsystems USB Reader</string>
@endverbatim

The reader name must use the ASCII character set.

@subsection CFBundleExecutable

   The executable name which exists in the particular platform's directory.

   Example:

@verbatim
   <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
   <string>libccid.so.0.4.2</string>
@endverbatim

@subsection ifdCapabilities

   List of capabilities supported by the driver. This is a bit field. Possible values are:

- 0
  No special capabilities
- 1 IFD_GENERATE_HOTPLUG
  The driver supports the hot plug feature.

As indicated in the XML file the DTD is available at
http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd.

@section SerialReaders Serial readers

Serial drivers must be configured to operate on a particular port and
respond to a particular name. The @c reader.conf file is used for this
purpose.

It has the following syntax:

@verbatim
# Configuration file for pcsc-lite
# David Corcoran <corcoran@musclecard.com>

FRIENDLYNAME  "Generic Reader"
DEVICENAME    /dev/ttyS0
LIBPATH       /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/libgen_ifd.so
CHANNELID     1
@endverbatim

The pound sign # denotes a comment.

@subsection FRIENDLYNAME
The FRIENDLYNAME field is an arbitrary text used to identify the reader.
This text is displayed by commands like @c pcsc_scan
https://pcsc-tools.apdu.fr/ that prints the
names of all the connected and detected readers.

@subsection DEVICENAME
The DEVICENAME field was not used for old drivers (using the IFD handler
version 2.0 or previous). It is now (IFD handler version 3.0) used to
identify the physical port on which the reader is connected.  This is
the device name of this port. It is dependent of the OS kernel. For
example the first serial port device is called @c /dev/ttyS0 under Linux
and @c /dev/cuaa0 under FreeBSD.

If you want to use IFDHCreateChannel() instead of
IFDHCreateChannelByName() then do not use any DEVICENAME line in the
configuration file.  IFDHCreateChannel() will then be called with the
CHANNELID parameter.

@subsection LIBPATH
The LIBPATH field is the filename of the driver code. The driver is a
dynamically loaded piece of code (generally a @c drivername.so* file).

@subsection CHANNELID
The CHANNELID is no more used for recent drivers (IFD handler 3.0) and
has been superseded by DEVICENAME.

If you have an old driver this field is used to indicate the port to
use. You should read your driver documentation to know what information
is needed here. It should be the serial port number for a serial reader.

CHANNELID was the numeric version of the port in which the reader will
be located. This may be done by a symbolic link where @c /dev/pcsc/1 is
the first device which may be a symbolic link to @c /dev/ttyS0 or
whichever location your reader resides.

/**
This function is required to open a communications channel to the port
listed by @p DeviceName.

Once the channel is opened the reader must be in a state in which it is
possible to query IFDHICCPresence() for card status.

@ingroup IFDHandler
@param[in] Lun Logical Unit Number\n
  Use this for multiple card slots or multiple readers. 0xXXXXYYYY -
  XXXX multiple readers, YYYY multiple slots. The resource manager will
  set these automatically. By default the resource manager loads a new
  instance of the driver so if your reader does not have more than one
  smart card slot then ignore the Lun in all the functions.\n
  \n
  PC/SC supports the loading of multiple readers through one instance of
  the driver in which XXXX is important. XXXX identifies the unique
  reader in which the driver communicates to. The driver should set up
  an array of structures that associate this XXXX with the underlying
  details of the particular reader.

@param[in] DeviceName Filename to use by the driver.\n
  For drivers configured by @p /etc/reader.conf this is the value of the
  field \ref DEVICENAME.
  \n
  For USB drivers the @p DeviceName must start with @p usb:VID/PID. VID
  is the Vendor ID and PID is the Product ID. Both are a 4-digits hex
  number.

Typically the string is generated by:

@code
printf("usb:%04x/%04x", idVendor, idProduct);
@endcode

The @p DeviceName string may also contain a more specialised
identification string. This additional information is used to
differentiate between two identical readers connected at the same time.
In this case the driver can't differentiate the two readers using VID
and PID and must use some additional information identifying the USB
port used by each reader.

- libusb

  For USB drivers using libusb-1.0 http://libusb.sourceforge.net/ for USB
  abstraction the @p DeviceName the string may be generated by:

  @code
  printf("usb:%04x/%04x:libusb-1.0:%d:%d:%d",
    idVendor, idProduct, bus_number, device_address, interface)
  @endcode

  So it is something like: <tt>usb:08e6/3437:libusb-1.0:7:99:0</tt> under
  GNU/Linux.

- libudev

  If pcscd is compiled with libudev support instead of libusb (default
  since pcsc-lite 1.6.8) the string will look like:

  @code
  printf("usb:%04x/%04x:libudev:%d:%s", idVendor, idProduct,
		bInterfaceNumber, devpath);
  @endcode

  bInterfaceNumber is the number of the interface on the device. It is
  only useful for devices with more than one CCID interface.

  devpath is the filename of the device on the file system.

  So it is something like:
  <tt>usb:08e6/3437:libudev:0:/dev/bus/usb/008/047</tt>
  under GNU/Linux.

- other

  If the driver does not understand the <tt>:libusb:</tt> or
  <tt>:libudev:</tt> scheme or if a new scheme is used, the driver should
  ignore the part it does not understand instead of failing.

  The driver shall recognize the <tt>usb:VID/PID</tt> part and, only if
  possible, the remaining of the DeviceName field.

  It is the responsibility of the driver to correctly identify the reader.

@note
The driver is responsible for knowing what type of card it has. If the
current slot/card contains a memory card then this command should ignore
the Protocol and use the MCT style commands for support for these style
cards and transmit them appropriately. If your reader does not support
memory cards or you don't want to implement this functionality, then
ignore this.

RxLength should be set to zero on error.
